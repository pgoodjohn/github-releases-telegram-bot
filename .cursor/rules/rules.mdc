# MODULAR CODE

- The code MUST be as modular as possible. Rust files should be small, MAXIMUM 300 lines per file
- Files MUST be as single purpose as possible.
- Much of the code right now does not respect the above. you MUST refactor the code you are changing if you see the above is not respected.

# TESTING YOUR CODE

- You MUST run `cargo check` any time you change rust code. There should be no errors.
- You MUST leave running and building the app to me. I WILL be performing those tasks NOT you.

# READING FILES
 - always read the file in full, do not be lazy 
 - before making any code changes, start by finding & reading ALL of the usages of a method or component
 - never make changes without reading the entire file 

# EGO 
- do not make assumption. do not jump to conclusions. 
- you are just a Large Language Model, you are very limited. 
- always consider multiple different approaches, just like a Senior
